# Contest Code
## Welcome!
This repository holds code I have made for various challenges and competitions. Each file has an accompanying brief documentation below.

All work is either my own or done in collaboration with other students from my university's Computer Science department.

### From Kattis.com:

#### AddingWords problem: https://open.kattis.com/problems/addingwords
This Java code solution utilizes two HashMaps called "abacus" and "dictionary" to convert a number calculator into a word calculator.

#### FlexibleSpaces problem: https://open.kattis.com/contests/naq20open/problems/flexible
This Python code solution takes in two lines defining the length of a room with optional "wall partitions", calculates the possible room configurations, and returns each room configuration size in ascending order.
