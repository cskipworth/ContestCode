# Contest Code
## Welcome!
This repository holds code I have made for various challenges and competitions. See below for each solution's accompanying brief documentation and a link to its challenge description.

All work is either my own or done in collaboration with other students from my university's Computer Science department.

### From Kattis.com:

#### AddingWords problem: https://open.kattis.com/problems/addingwords
This Java code solution utilizes two HashMaps called "abacus" and "dictionary" to convert a number calculator into a word calculator. <br />

#### FlexibleSpaces problem: https://open.kattis.com/contests/naq20open/problems/flexible
This Python code solution takes in two lines defining the length of a room with optional "wall partitions", calculates the possible room configurations, and returns each room configuration size in ascending order. <br />

#### SantaKlas problem: https://open.kattis.com/problems/santaklas
This Java code solution uses some basic trigonometric math to calculate and return whether or not "Santa's sleigh" will hit the ground or not; if it won't, it returns string "safe", and if it will, it returns the distance until the sleigh hits the ground. <br />
